0.0.0.0/0 ---> represented to internet. anyone can use.

Linux is a kernel not OS. it does't have UI, Shell

kernel is responsible for connecting to hardware.

kernel + shell + UI = OS 

servers doesn't have UI. Only kernel and shell.

ssh -i  #-i means identity file private key

absolute path / relative path.

$ --> normal user
# --> root user
/ --> home directory

uname --> kernel name {example Linux}

--help vs man 
--------------
1. --help prints available options. 
2. man command prints options with description.

ls -lr --> reverse format
ls -lt --> latest files on top
ls -ltr --> old files are on top

class-2

CRUD
----
create --> create facebook account
read --> login facebook account
update --> post something
delete --> delete the post.


rmdir --> only deletes empty directory
rm -r --> delete forcefully

cp --> copy the files as well as change the file names as well
grep <word_to_find> <which_file>

Linux is case sensitive.

we have two files,
DevOps
DEVOPS

grep DevOps ---> it finds the word.
grep Devops ---> not find the word
grep -i Devops #we are telling find that word insensitive mode 

wget vs curl
------------
wget download the file.
curl display the content in the terminal. 

cut vs awk :- important
----------
delimitor --> this means we separate words using symbols below.
:
/
https://github.com/akkimahesh/terraform-iam-lambda-dynamodb

cut -d : f1 --> print this one "https"
cut -d / f3 --> print this one "github.com"

question
--------
cut command is to print the fragments by using delimitor. delimitor is our wish based on the input given.

awk 
---
https://github.com/akkimahesh/terraform-iam-lambda-dynamodb
awk -F / '{print $1F} --> prints first fragment "https"
awk -F / '{print $NF} --> prints last fragment "terraform-iam-lambda-dynamodb"

used for rows and column based Data.

vim editor
----------
:set nu ---> display number for each line.
:set nonu

:/ search from top
:? search from buttom
:/<word> search the word {like :/bin}
:noh not highlate

esc mode in vim editor
----------------------
shift+g --> go to buttom 
shift+gg --> go to buttom
u --> undo
dd --> cut the lines

replace the word
----------------
:s/<wordtofind>/<wordtoreplace> ---> change only where cursor have
:%s/<wordtofind>/<wordtoreplace>/g ---> change the all words (global)
:2s/<wordtofind>/<wordtoreplace> ---> change the word particular line

user management
---------------
getent group --> print group entries

To login with created user you need to do some configuration.
-------------------------------------------------------------
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sshd -t # if any worng configuration it shows.

id Mahesh
it prints the user id group id that Mahesh is belongs to..

groupadd devops #to create the group.

usermod -g <groupname> <username>
