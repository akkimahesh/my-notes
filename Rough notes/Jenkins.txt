catalogue.zip is your zip file name how you want. 
./* --> include all files from current directory.
-x ---> include unwanted files.
-x ".zip" --> if we run same command second time there will another zip file created. so for safety not included that second zip file.

   steps {
       script {
            def params: [
                string(name: 'version', value: "${  }"),
                string(name: 'environment', value: "dev")  #Here values replace in child job.
            ]
            build job: "<child-job-name>", wait: true   #this block tells that after completed the parent job it call the child job  for execution.
       }
   }
}
